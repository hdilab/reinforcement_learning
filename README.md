# Reinforcement Learning Alogorithms

### Introduction
This repository contains very simple implementations of current mainstream Reinforcement Learning Algorithms.
The goal is not to create the most efficient, robust versions rather it is to understand the intuition behind
the original algorithms.

For a more optimized version please look at Open AI baselines or Spinning Up.

### Contents
The repository contains the following algorithms
- Q Learning
- DQN
- Policy Gradients
- Actor Critic
- PPO

### Next Steps
Implement more efficient versions and bench mark them on different games.
